## ResNet-50 Multi-GPU Implementation on TensorFlow

This repository presents a simple to understand and easy to follow guide of implementing ResNet-50 in TensorFlow. It is recommended to first study ResNet paper avialable [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

Input to the network is fed through [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets) file, made separately for training and testing.

All the parameters are placed in ``` param.py```
